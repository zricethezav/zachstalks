### What is this
I like to listen to talks when I clean the house and move about. I would use the youtube mobile app IF it allowed you to listen to audio while your screen is off. But it doesn't (also youtube suggestions and ads are terrible things causing harm to our brains. dont forget u are the product). Anyways here's a little system that solves my problem. This script will download youtube audio and upload it to IPFS so that you may download it where and whenever. The hash and video title will be appended to this readme. Click the ipfs link associated with the title and there ya go, youtube audio.

### What you need
- IPFS
- youtube-dl
- ffmpeg
- curiosity


### How to use
```
python thing.py {youtube-url}
